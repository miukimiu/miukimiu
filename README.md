### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miuki Miu (real name Elizabet ðŸ™ƒ). I'm a designer who codes!

I started my career as a web developer, and soon I realized that I prefer the more visual side of the web. I love interaction design, front-end technology, animation, and I'm obsessed with making the web fun again!

I am passionate about open-source. In April 2018, my project [React Kawaii](https://github.com/miukimiu/react-kawaii) won the "Fun Project of the Year" award at React Amsterdam!

Music was also a big part of my life. I was the first female solo Hip-Hop artist signing to a major label (Universal Music) in Portugal. My songs reached the top of MTV Portugal's charts, but I soon realized that I was not meant to be an artist. <b>I found out that I'm much happier designing, coding, and speaking at conferences all around the world!</b>

In a nutshell, 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Elastic](https://elastic.github.io/) as a Product Designer who codes.
- ðŸ¤” I love contributing to and helping out other open-source projects.
- ðŸŽ§ I recorded a Hip-Hop song called [Fork this](https://github.com/miukimiu/fork-this) to encourage women to follow their passion. 
- ðŸŽ¤ I talked at some of the biggest React conferences around the world! Check them out on my [website](https://www.miukimiu.com/). 
- ðŸ¤—ðŸ’™ I've also mentored other designers and developers. I believe in an open and supportive tech community! So, my [DMs](http://www.twitter.com/miukimiu) are always open.
